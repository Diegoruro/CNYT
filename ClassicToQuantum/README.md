# Classic to quantum.


## Getting Started

In order to use the following functions you´ll need to use tuples instead of the normal structure of the complex numbers the following example will guide you on how to convert normal expression into tuples.
```
3+2i->( real, imaginary )
(3,2)
```

For more examples use the test file [ClassicTest.py ](https://github.com/Diegoruro/CNYT/blob/master/ClassicToQuantum/ClassicTest.py).
## Prerequisites
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) version 3.7 or higher
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [pyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/pycharm/)
- Matplotlib and numpy libraries

To use this library you need python, at least 3.7 version, if you already have python installed, to check if it is 3.7 or higher use the following command in cmd.

```
python --version
```

### Installing

These are the instructions to use the library.
follow the step by step to install the library.

copy the link of the repository with the following steps:

 - Get into the main git of the repository.

## Running the tests

To run the test of the library you´ll need to open the following file.
```
ClassicTest.py
```
It will show you some test of every function of the library.

The following steps will show you how to run it with [pyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/pycharm/)

- Open the file [ClassicTest.py ](https://github.com/Diegoruro/CNYT/blob/master/ClassicToQuantum/ClassicTest.py) with [pyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/pycharm/).
