# Double Slit Experiment.

This experiment allow us to understand the basic principle of quantum mechanics.


## Materials

In order to perform this experiment we need the following materials.
- Aluminum foil
- Scalpels
- A sheet of paper
- A laser pointer


### Double slit model.

The following construction is a model of a Double slit and in order to perform this experiment we need to make it.

## Running the Experiment

To run the Experiment we need to use the laser pointer aiming to the two slits of the aluminium foil and this will be the result.

## Simulation with libraries.
In order to simulate the experiment in a common computer we will use the [ClassicToQuantum](https://github.com/Diegoruro/CNYT/tree/master/ClassicToQuantum) folder which has the libraries to perform the simulation of this experiment.
