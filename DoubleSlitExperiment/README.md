additionally the program graphs the probabilities of the quantum systems.


## Materials

In order to perform this experiment we need the following materials.
- Aluminum foil
- Scalpels
- A sheet of paper
- A laser pointer


### Double slit model.

The following construction is a model of a Double slit and in order to perform this experiment we need to make it.
